description:
This is a small-scale graph constructed to test whether the program can calculate the correct results.

Input:
6 7 3
1 2 40
1 3 10
2 4 10
3 4 40
3 5 20
4 6 20
5 6 30
1 6
2 6
1 4

Output(Fibonacci)

The result using Fibonacci Heap is: 
60 30 50 
The time using Fibonacci Heap is: 0


Output(Priority_Queue)

The result using Priority Queue is:
60 30 50 
The time using Priority Queue is: 0



The output of the program is consistent with the expectation, and the correct result is output.
