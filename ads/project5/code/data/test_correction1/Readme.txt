This testing file is generated randomly to test the correction of the program.
n=9   m=4


According to the results, we can find that the two pictures are the same. 
It is obvious that No rectangles overlap each other, and thus, the result is not wrong.
Because it is an approximate algorithm, we do not need to do strict proof of correctness.
Intuitively, this arrangement is the best.
